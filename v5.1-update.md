As the title suggests, this update has **two** main topics:
- Performance improvement.
- Color palette change.

<br>

### Performance Improvement
Before the update, all pages had an animated gradient at the top. However, this gradient was removed as it affected performance and animated images were added.

### Color Palette
The dark mode color of the site has been changed to the new color that came with the Tailwind update. The new color will be more suitable for the dark theme as it contains less blue tones.
